# neetcode_scraper
Quick Selenium script to scrape neetcode.io and convert to CSV.

Convert the top 150 leetcode problems into a convenient CSV file for tracking, note-tacking, etc. Requires the Chrome Beta executable. I'll turn this into a more polished script eventually. Thanks to neetcode for compiling this list and for extremely helpful video walkthroughs of Leetcode problems.
